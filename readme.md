# AKS Portal

----
## What is AKS Portal?

AKS Portal is a simple customer and vendor management application. This system was created for Aqua Klean Systems, a company I work for, and use it everyday. With AKS Portal, a business can:

- Manage customers and their contacts
- Manage vendors and their contacts
- Create sale orders for customers
- Create purchase orders for vendors
- Purchase orders are associated with sale orders
- Visual status of purchase or sale orders (working or complete)

## Why?

There are three reasons for AKS Portal:

1. To teach myself:
 - Laravel 
 - API Development
 - Angular JS
 - Twitter Bootstrap
 - git, gulp, and composer workflow

2. To facilitate AKS day-today operations 
3. To open the source in the hopes of helping a fellow developer understand how these technologies work together.

## Planned Features

As our company uses AKS Portal, additional features have been requested. In no particular order, I list them here for tracking purposes:

- Implement `Escape` and `Enter` keys which would map to "OK" and "CANCEL" in dialog pop-ups.
- Implement avatars in user profiles
- Implement user password recovery
